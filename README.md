# Simon Nguyen — ACD-E25 Portfolio

## Overview
This portfolio documents four computational design studies developed for *Advanced Computational Design*. Across the series, I explore how **rule-based systems, parametric logic, and field-driven behaviors** can be used to generate architectural form, structure, and spatial organization. The work moves from discrete 2D pattern logic to spatial, structural, and agent-based systems.

## About Me
My name is **Simon Nguyen** (25), and I hold a Bachelor’s degree in **Civil & Architectural Engineering**. I am currently a first-year Master’s student in the **Centre for Computational Research in Emergent Architectural Technology and Engineering**, where I focus on computational design approaches within architecture and the built environment.

My interests lie in the intersection of **computational design, architectural form, and structural logic**. I am particularly engaged in using rule-based systems, parametric methods, and algorithmic thinking to explore how design intent, performance, and emergence can be integrated into architectural workflows.

## Assignments

### A1 · NumPy Array Manipulation for 2D Pattern Generation
A study in pixel-based pattern generation using array logic and controlled randomness. The assignment focuses on compositional rules, iteration, and variation within a constrained system.

### A2 · Exploring Fractals through Recursive Geometric Patterns
An exploration of recursion and hierarchical growth through geometric rules. I investigate how depth, scaling, and branching logic influence density, legibility, and emergent structure.

### A3 · Parametric Structural Canopy
A parametric canopy system driven by a heightmap and implemented in Grasshopper/GhPython. The project examines tessellation, panelization, and structural logic responding to curvature, span, and local conditions.

### A4 · Agent-Based Modeling for Surface Panelization
An agent-based approach to surface sampling and panelization. Local behavioral rules are used to negotiate global coherence, balancing proximity, alignment, and boundary constraints.

## Highlights
- **Core theme:** Rule-based systems and emergent architectural form  
- **Key interest:** Translating computational logic into architectural and structural systems  
- **Next step:** Integrating material and structural feedback earlier in the generative design process
